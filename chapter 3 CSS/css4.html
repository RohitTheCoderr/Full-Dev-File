    <h3>Font Properties In Html</h3>
    <div> font tags in used in html css for style of pages it is very important <br>
        The &lt;font&gt; tag is a deprecated HTML tag. Instead of it, use CSS styles (see an example below)1. You can use the CSS font property to change the font of a text2. The font property may be specified as either a single keyword, which will select a system font, or as a shorthand for various font-related properties3.

            Here is an example of how to change the font in CSS:
            
           <p> p {
              font-family: Arial;
              font-size: 20px;
              color: blue;
            } 
        </p>
            Copy
            This will change the font family to Arial, the font size to 20 pixels and the color to blue for all paragraphs in your HTML document4.
            
            I hope this helps. Let me know if you have any other questions.
