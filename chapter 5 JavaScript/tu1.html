        // different between var const let
        
        // after use var you can change or any body can change variable value in console like you can try in console
        // var dulha = "Lab";  
        // var dulhan = "Laby";
        
        // But after use const you and anybody can't change variable value in console because you used a const you can try it in console
        const dulha = "Lab";  
        const dulhan = "Laby";
        
        // we will understand about let in future so wait guys
       
        // Here In a hosting and hoisting are big diffenrent like
        // hoisting - vaeriable and functions are hoisted which means there declaration is moved on the top of code
     // you can see  a is declared in top but not initialize before console.log(a) so this is colled hoisting
        // It is just only for understanding
            // var a;      // this is called Declaration 
            //  a = 1234     // this is called inisilysation
          var a;
        // here we declaraled a var and next line print this and than after initialize that so thats why our result is undefine 
        
         console.log(a);   
         a = 12;   
         
        //  here we want to print b but here b is not a variable declaration and not a initialize so thats why result is not-define 
         console.log(b);

    //   difference betweeen Undefine and Not- define in javascripts

    //   In JavaScript, they both are related to memory space and there is a very simple difference between
    //  them. If the variable name which is being accessed doesn’t exist in memory space then it would be
    //  not defined, and if exists in memory space but hasn’t been assigned any value till now, then it would
    //  be undefined.
