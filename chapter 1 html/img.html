        An image is a visual representation of something. It can be a two-dimensional (2D) representation, such as a drawing, <br>
        painting, or photograph, or a three-dimensional (3D) object, such as a carving or sculpture1. You can find images on <br>
        the internet by using search engines like Google Images2 or Pexels3. Is there anything else I can help you with? ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
