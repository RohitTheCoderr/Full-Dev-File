    <h3>Semantic element</h3>
    <div>
      HTML Semantic Elements are elements that clearly describe their meaning to
      both the browser and the developer. They are used to create a structure
      for the web page, making it easier to understand and maintain. Examples of
      semantic elements include &lt;header&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;,
      &lt;article&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, and &lt;aside&gt;1
    </div>
    Some more information about semantic elements in HTML is that they have
    intrinsic meaning and convey that meaning both to the browser and the
    developer. They clearly define what kind of content they contain (for
    example, the &lt;footer&gt; tag is used instead of &lt;div
    id="footer"&gt;)1. Would you like me to look up more information on this
    topic?
